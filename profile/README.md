# ðŸª“ & ðŸ§¹

Welcome to the axe-and-broom GitHub org. We are a couple of developers who specialize in platform work who believe in the power a solid platform for software projects and the importance of practices and foundational modules to keep all contributors production to deliver more software faster.

We are also big fans of keeping our decisions and resonings documented and transparent. We believe that this is a good way to keep the team aligned and to help new members to understand the context and the reasons behind the decisions that were made. During our careers, working with clients we have learned a ton of things and we want to share our knowledge with the community through this organization.

## ADRs

In the spirit of keeping to patterns and practices, we have decided to use ADRs (Architectural Decision Records) to document our learnings and decision. We believe that this is a good format to share our learnings together with the important reasoning behind them.

Please see the [ADR repository](https://github.com/axe-and-broom/adr) for more information.

## Skeleton repositories

We intend to create a set of skeleton repositories that can be used as a starting point for new projects. These repositories will contain a set of best practices and foundational modules that we believe are important for a solid platform.

## Shared Github Actions

We also intend to create a set of shared Github Actions with a focus on making it easier to keep the quality and efficiency of your projects high.

## Contributing

We are open to contributions and we would love to hear from you. Please feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you have any feedback or if you would like to contribute to the organization.
